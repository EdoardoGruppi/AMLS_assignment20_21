## Before starting

### Packages required

The following lists gather all the packages needed to run the project code.
Please note that the descriptions provided in this subsection are taken directly from the package source pages. In order to have more details on them it is reccomended to directly reference to their official sites.

Compulsory

- `Pandas` provides fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with structured and time series data both easy and intuitive.

- `Numpy` is the fundamental package for array computing with Python.

- `Tensorflow ` is an open source software library for high performance numerical computation. Its allows easy deployment of computation across a variety of platforms (CPUs, GPUs, TPUs). **Important**: Recently Keras has been completely wrapped within Tensorflow.

- `Pathlib ` offers a set of classes to handle filesystem paths.

- `Shutil` provides a number of high-level operations on files and collections of files. In particular, functions are provided which support file copying and removal.

- `Os` provides a portable way of using operating system dependent functionality.

- `Matplotlib` is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

- `Sklearn` offers simple and efficient tools for predictive data analysis.

- `Random ` implements pseudo-random number generators for various distributions.

Optional

- `seaborn` is a data visualization library based on matplotlib that provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

- `comet_ml` helps to manage and track machine learning experiments.

### Software used
