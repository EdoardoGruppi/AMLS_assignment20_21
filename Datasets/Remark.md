# Remark

+ Keep this folder empty while submitting your code. Use this folder for your programming only.
+ If you need to pre-process the dataset, do not save the intermediate results or pre-processed dataset. Your final submission must directly read the files we provided. 
+ The pre-trained models (especially for DNN models), is allowed to be saved in the folder for each task. 
+ When assessing your code, we will copy-paste the dataset into this folder. Then, your project should looks like:
  + AMLS_20-21_SN12345678
    + A1
    + A2
    + B1
    + B2
